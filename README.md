# SiriBar #

SiriBar is a little project written by me that simulates the Siri interface from the iPhone.

## How to add it ##

1. Copy SiriBar.h and SiriBar.m to your project.
2. Add an NSObject, and change the class to SiriBar.
3. Connect a window (for best effect make this window 200px high) to the window object.
4. (optional) If you want an extra button, connect a button to the extrabutton object (so it can hide and show at the appropriate time)
It's that easy!
